## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- **Bonus**: Use [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) to create an interactive location map with custom location pin

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- GSAP animation
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### What I learned

- In most frontend projects that I have worked on, I was never provided with a dedicated design file
for the design system. So this time, I tried to approach this project differently by coding a page for
the design system itself and it was a good thing because it helped me write my css styles without any
context of where the components would be used which resulted in a much leaner and cleaner stylesheet.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

### Useful resources
